# ML_from_scratch
Machine Learning from scratch - Educational implementation in of neural networks in NumPy

Building neural networks from first principles to understand their mathematical foundations and behavioral properties.

## CURRENT PROGRESS:

**✅ COMPLETED:**
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): Complete 
- Optimizers (SGD, RMSprop, ADAM): Complete
- Dropout layers: Complete
- Gradients visualization: Complete

**🔧 IN DEVELOPMENT:**
- CNN Architecture - Forward pass implemented, backprop in development (Only the conv layer remain)

**📋 PLANNED:**
- RNN with phase transition analysis
- LSTM networks
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)


**Research:** Phase transitions in RNN dynamics
**Approach:** Mathematical foundations through from-scratch implementation
