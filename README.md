# ML_from_scratch
Machine Learning from scratch - Educational implementation in of neural networks in NumPy

Building neural networks from first principles to understand their mathematical foundations and behavioral properties.

CURRENT PROGRESS:
✅ Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): Complete
✅ Optimizers (SGD, RMSprop, ADAM): Complete
✅ Dropout layers: Complete
✅ Gradients visualization: Complete
🔧 CNN Architecture: Forward Pass implemented, backprop in developpmentL
❌ RNN: Planned (with phase transition analysis)
❌ LSTM: Planned
❌ PINN: Planned
